NAME
    OpusVL::AppKitX::CMSView - CMS front end

DESCRIPTION
METHODS
  finalize_error
    The CMS view overrides this method to provide a custom error page.

    First it looks for a page on the site with the url /500. If that can not
    be found it checks to see if there is a template file defined in the
    custom_error_template config setting. If not it reverts to using it's
    standard 500.tt provided with this module.

    If you provide your own template using the custom_error_template you
    need to be aware that the TT is setup to look in the root directory
    rather than root/templates. This is because the usual directory search
    path hookup isn't performed since it's a different view to the usual
    AppKitTT view.

    Catalyst logs the real error as an [error] message so this hook doesn't
    attempt to log the error again.
